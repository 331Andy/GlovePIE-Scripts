# GlovePIE-Scripts

Wii remote and Nunchuk scripts for video games.

## Usage
1) Download the latest version of GlovePIE from https://github.com/Ravbug/GlovePIE 
2) Download the script you want, and open it up in GlovePIE.
3) Make sure you are using a "non-TR" Wii Remote (RVL-CNT-01), otherwise your Windows Bluetooth won't be able to read its inputs.
4) Press 'Run' in GlovePIE with the script open.
5) Either press the 'sync' button at the back of the Wiimote, or press the 1 and 2 buttons at the same time to trigger a Bluetooth sync.
6) Wait for Windows to finish configuring and syncing the Wiimote (there should be two notification pop-ups). You should see a single blue light on the Wiimote.
7) Press 'Stop' in GlovePIE. You should observe the blue light on the Wiimote turn off.
8) Press 'Run' once again in GlovePIE. It takes about 5 seconds for the Wiimote (and nunchuk) to fully calibrate every time the script is run. Make sure you do not move the Wiimote during this time.
